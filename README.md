## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was given the scaffold and method signatures to make testing the code easier. I had to come up with the RL algorithm myself and fine tune configurations to get the agents to work. 
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists use logic to solve problems. Due to how pervasive computer science is and how pervasive it now is, computer scientists have signficant impact on the world. The scale at which computers can impact the world has also become unbelievably large.
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically. The first step is to understand the problem well and also understand what solutions are not acceptable. Once that is done, define requirements, plan a solution, implement it and verify that it solves the requirements previuosly stated.
### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My responsibility is to aim to solve the user and the organization's goals without harming anyone.
